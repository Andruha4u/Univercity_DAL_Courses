Useful extensions :
-  [ESLint] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). This extension highlights linting errors/warnings during development, so it is easier to fix linting problems.

## IDE
We recommend installing [VS Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com) IDE.
